OrdforandeLista is a full-stack application designed to increase visibility for women in board positions in Sweden.
This repository contains the Spring Boot backend, responsible for authentication, profile management, admin review, and data persistence.

🎯 Project Goal

Women are still underrepresented in Swedish corporate boards.
OrdforandeLista provides a platform where qualified women can:

✅ Submit their board-ready profile

✅ Be reviewed by administrators
✅ Become publicly visible once approved

This backend powers:
- User registration & profile submission
- Tag (kompetens) management
- Admin review and approval workflow
- JWT-based authentication & authorization
- GraphQL API for frontend consumption
